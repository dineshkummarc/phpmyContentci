  1. First of all, Make a Full Backup. We cannot stress enough how important it is to *always* take a full backup
      before attempting any kind of update. Both for Server Side and Android Side. A full backup should be taken
      of both the codes and the database.
  2. Upload the "application" folder to your existing installation folder replacing any existing folders & files.
  3. Import "UPDATE_SQL.sql" into your database via PhpMyAdmin.
